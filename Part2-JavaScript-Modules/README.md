# Part 2 - JavaScript Modules

Did you know? With modern Javascript, we can also separate our functions in multiple files! Resulting in an even better organised and readable way!
This is done by making use of the `import/export` directives.

Not only does it allow us to import/export functions, but also variables, objects, classes, ...!

## ðŸŒ± Must-have's

1. Create a new javascript file per function you have. (or any other structure that makes sense to you - the bigger your projects, the more useful this will become)
2. Give the file the same name as your function and move your actual functions into these files.
    * _Just remember: keep `script.js` around, it will still be the origin file for everything._
3. Rename `script.js` to `index.js`.
    * _This is a convention that insures better compatibility with several tools later on (you will see)._ ðŸ˜‰
4. Apply the ES6 import/export syntax and connect all your javascript files to your `index.js`.
    * _Ps. Don't forget to check your HTML as well to load JS in a way that supports modules. (hint: `type="module"`)_
